# Overview
Monsters are spawned at the gate and keep running in the map shown below.   
The map is divided into two parts: inner circle and outer circle.  
In the inner circle, enemies appear in the south part of the gate and move along the road.  
In the outer circle, enemies keep moving counterclockwise until players kill them.  
The priority job is to keep the total number of monsters fewer than the maximum until the last wave and destroy the final boss.
